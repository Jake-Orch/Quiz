# Quiz
In this project i was tasked with creating a quiz, in which the user can save their score to the local server with their own initials. There was no starter code provided. The quiz i decided to create is a planetary quiz. I created the timer loop and made it go on for 60 seconds, provided the user either gets no answers incorrect (this deducts 5 seconds of their timer) or completes the quiz withing the time allocated. I then used data attributes to allow me to know if the clicked answer is indeed correct or incorrect. and using this information I made the click hide the current question and display the next one, and depending on if the answer is correct or not, add a point to the users score and show the clicked element in green or deduct 5 seconds from the timer and display the clicked element in red. at the end of the quiz the user is shown a form where they can put their initials and score to be saved to the local server.
